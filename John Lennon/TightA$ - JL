Just as tight as you can make it
Hard and slow ain't hard enough
Just as tight as you can shake it girl
Git it on and do your stuff
Tight as you can get it
Tight as got it made
Uptight's alright but if ya can't stand the heat
You better get back in the shade
Just as tight as an Indian rope trick
Long and tough ain't hard enough
Just as tight as a dope fiend's fix my friend
Git it up and do your stuff
Tight as you can boogie
Tight as got it made
Uptight's alright but if ya can't stand the heat
you better get back in the shade
Well tight as got me cornered
Tight as got me laid
Tight as strut your stuff so tough
Just a sweating in the midnight shade
