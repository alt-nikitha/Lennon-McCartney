People say I'm crazy
Doing what I'm doing
Well, they give me all kinds of warnings
To save me from ruinWhen I say that I'm okay
Well, they look at me kinda strange
Surely you're not happy now
You no longer play the gamePeople say I'm lazy
Dreaming my life away
Well, they give me all kinds of advice
Designed to enlighten me

When I tell them that I'm doing fine
Watching shadows on the wall
Don't you miss the big time, boy?
You're no longer on the ballI'm just sitting here
Watching the wheels go round and round
I really love to watch them rollNo longer riding on the merry-go-round
I just had to let it goAh, people asking questions
Lost in confusion
Well, I tell them, there's no problem
Only solutions

Well, they shake their heads
And they look at me as if I've lost my mind
I tell them, there's no hurry
I, I'm just sitting here doing time
I'm just sitting here
Watching the wheels go round and round
I really love to watch them roll
No longer riding on the merry-go-round
I just had to let it go
I just had to let it go
I just had to let it go
