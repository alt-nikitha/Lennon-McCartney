Out the blue you came to me
And blew away life's misery
Out the blue life's energy
Out the blue you came to me
Everyday I thank the Lord and Lady
For the way that you came to me
Anyway, it had to be
Two minds, one destiny
Out the blue you came to me
And blew away life's misery
Out the blue life's energy
Out the blue you came to me
All my life's been a long slow knife
I was born just to get to you
Anyway, I survived
Long enough to make you my wife
Out the blue you came to me
And blew away life's misery
Out the blue life's energy
Out the blue you came to me
Like a UFO you came to me
And blew away life's misery
Out the blue life's energy
Out the blue you came to me
