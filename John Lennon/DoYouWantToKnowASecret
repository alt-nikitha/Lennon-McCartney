You'll never know how much I really love you
You'll never know how much I really care
Listen, do you want to know a secret?
Do you promise not to tell?
Whoa-oh-oh, closer
Let me whisper in your ear
Say the words you long to hear
I'm in love with you, ooh
Listen (doo da do), do you want to know a secret? (doo da do)
Do you promise not to tell? (doo da do)
Whoa-oh-oh, closer (doo da do)
Let me whisper in your ear (doo da do)
Say the words you long to hear
I'm in love with you, ooh
I've known a secret for a week or two
Nobody knows, just we two
Listen (doo da do), do you want to know a secret? (doo da do)
Do you promise not to tell? (doo da do)
Whoa-oh-oh, closer (doo da do)
Let me whisper in your ear (doo da do)
Say the words you long to hear
I'm in love with you, ooh, ooh, ooh
