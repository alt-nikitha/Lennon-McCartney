That boy
Took my love away
Though he'll regret it someday
But this boy wants you back again
That boy
Isn't good for you
Though he may want you, too
This boy wants you back again
Oh, and this boy would be happy
Just to love you, but oh my
That boy won't be happy
'Til he's seen you cry
This boy
Wouldn't mind the pain
Would always feel the same
If this boy gets you back again
This boy, this boy, this boy
