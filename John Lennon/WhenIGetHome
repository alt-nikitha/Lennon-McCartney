Whoa oh ah, whoa oh ah
I got a whole lot of things to tell her
When I get home
Come on, out my way
'Cause I'ma gonna see my baby today
I've got a whole lot of things I've gotta say
To her
Whoa oh ah, whoa oh ah
I got a whole lot of things to tell her
When I get home
Come on, if you please
I've got no time for trivialities
I've got a girl who's waiting home for me
Tonight
Whoa oh ah, whoa oh ah
I got a whole lot of things to tell her
When I get home
When I'm getting home tonight
I'm gonna hold her tight
I'm gonna love her 'til the cows come home
I bet I'll love her more
'Til I walk out that door again
Come on, let me through
I got so many things I gotta do
I got no business being here with you
This way
Whoa oh ah, whoa oh ah
I got a whole lot of things to tell her
When I get home, yeah
I've got a whole lot of things to tell her
When I get home
