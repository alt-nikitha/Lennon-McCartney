Even though I may not be singing it movin' along
I'm just trying to, "if I get to the bottom of the"
And then it goes to
Have extra on the first one
So it's going, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Well, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo
Helter Skelter, take seventeen
One, two, three, four
When I get to the bottom
I go back to the top of the hill
Where I stop and I turn and I give you a thrill
'Til I get to the bottom and I see you again
Yeah, yeah
Well, do you, don't you want me to love you?
I'm coming down fast but I'm miles above you
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me the answer
You may be a lover but you ain't no dancer
Oh, look out
Helter skelter, helter skelter
Helter skelter
Woo
Well, will you, won't you, want me to make you?
I'm coming down fast but don't let me break you
Well, tell me, tell me, tell me the answer
You may be a lover but you ain't no dancer
Woo, look out
Helter skelter, helter skelter
Helter skelter
Helter Skelter, woo
Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo
Woo, ooh, woo, ooh
Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo
Well, goin' to the la, la, la, na, na, na, na
And I get to the bottom and I see you again, yeah, yeah
Do you, don't you, want me to love you?
Well, I'm coming down fast but I'm miles above you
Now tell me, tell me, tell me the answer
You may be a lover but you ain't no dancer
Ooh, na, na
Helter skelter, helter skelter
Helter skelter
Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo
Woo
Helter skelter
Helter skelter
Helter skelter
Helter skelter
Oh yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Keep that one
Mark it "fab"
