And if I say I really knew you well
What would your answer be?
If you were here today
Ooo ooo ooo, here today
Well, knowing you
You'd probably laugh and say
That we were worlds apart
If you were here today
Ooo ooo ooo, here today
But as for me,
I still remember how it was before
And I am holding back the tears no more
Ooo ooo ooo, I love you, ooo
What about the time we met?
Well, I suppose that you could say
That we were playing hard to get
Didn't understand a thing
But we could always sing
What about the night we cried?
Because there wasn't any reason
Left to keep it all inside
Never understood a word
But you were always there with a smile
And if I say I really loved you
And was glad you came along
And you were here today
Ooo ooo ooo, for you were in my song
Ooo ooo ooo, here today
