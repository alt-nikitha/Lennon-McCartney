Look what you're doin', I'm feeling blue and lonely
Would it be too much to ask of you
What you're doin' to me?
You got me runnin' and there's no fun in it
Why should it be so much to ask of you
What you're doin' to me?
I've been waitin' here for you
Wond'ring what you're gonna do
Should you need a love that's true
It's me
Please stop your lyin', you've got me cryin', girl
Why should it be so much to ask of you
What you're doin' to me?

What you're doin' to me?
What you're doin' to me?
