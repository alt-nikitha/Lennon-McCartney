Don't get too tired for love
Don't let it end
Don't say goodnight to love
It may never be the same again
Don't say it
Don't say it
Say anything but don't say goodnight tonight
Don't say it
Don't say it
Say anything but don't say goodnight tonight
Don't say it
Don't say it
You can say anything but don't say goodnight tonight
Don't say it
Don't say it
Say anything but don't say goodnight tonight
Don't say it
Don't say it
Say anything but don't say goodnight tonight
Don't get too tired for love
Don't let it end
Don't say goodnight to love
It's a feeling that may never end
Don't say it
Don't say it
Say anything but don't say goodnight tonight
Don't say it
Don't say it
Say anything but don't say goodnight tonight
Don't say it
Don't say it
You can say anything but don't say goodnight tonight
