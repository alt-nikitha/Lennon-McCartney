Don't go jumping waterfalls
Please keep to the lake
People who jump waterfalls
Sometimes can make mistakes
And I need love, yeah I need love
Like a second needs an hour
Like a raindrop needs a shower
Yeah I need love every minute of the day
And it wouldn't be the same
If you ever should decide to go away
And I need love, yeah I need love
Like a castle needs a tower
Like a garden needs a flower
Yeah I need love every minute of the day
And it wouldn't be the same
If you ever should decide to go away
Don't go chasing polar bears
In the great unknown
Some big friendly polar bear
Might want to take you home
And I need love, yeah I need love
Like a castle needs a tower
Like a garden needs a flower
Yeah I need love, say I need love
Like a raindrop needs a shower
Like a second needs an hour
Every minute of the day
And it wouldn't be the same
If you ever should decide to go away
Don't go jumping waterfalls
