You should have seen me with the pokerman
I had no money and I bet a grand
Just in the nick of time I look at his hand
I was talking to an Eskimo
Said he was hoping for a fall of snow
When you popped a sealion ready to go
Let's go let's go let go let go
Down to junior's farm where I want to lay low
How life, high life, go let's go 
Take me down to Junior's farm
Take me down Jimmy
I took my bag into a grocer's store
The price is higher than the time before
Old man asked me why is it more
I said you should have seen me with the pokerman
I had no money and I bet a grand
Just in the nick of time I looked at his hand
Let's go let's go let go let go
Down to junior's farm Where I want to lay low
How life, high life, go let's go 
Take me down to Junior's farm
Let's go let's go 
Down to junior's farm where I want to lay low
How life, high life, go let's go 
Take me down to Junior's farm
Everybody tag along
Take me down to Junior's farm
Take me back
\Take me back
I want to go back
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
